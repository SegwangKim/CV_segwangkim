Driven Cavity Problem with 5th WENO \\ 
The fluid dynamics in a 2d-rectangle with obstacles can be described as Navier-stokes equations.
To obtain a numerical solution of the non-linear PDEs, I did a C++ implementation of 5th WENO methods using sparse matrices.
Refer to MATLAB simulations of computed solutions (\href{https://segwangkim.github.io/notes/fluid1.gif}{demo1}, \href{https://segwangkim.github.io/notes/fluid2.gif}{demo2}).\\

\noindent 
My main interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in compositional generalization abilities of deep learning sequence-to-sequence models.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploring the expressivity of deep learning models: Prior to attacking tasks using a deep learning model, one needs to check that the expressivity of the model is enough.
    Inspired by number sequence prediction problems for testing human intelligence, we measured the computational powers of deep learning models using the problems and corresponding Automata \textbf{(published in AAAI 2019)}.  
    \item Proposing models that learn inductive bias:
    A possible deep learning method for learning a task is to design a new architecture specialized for the task. 
    Motivated by an inductive bias necessary for learning arithmetic operations, I suggested a neural sequence-to-grid module that can automatically align an input sequence into a grid \textbf{(published in AAAI 2021)}.
    The module successfuly enhanced a neural network like CNN to generalize on out-of-distribution examples of number sequence prediction problems or computer program evaluation problems.
    \item Designing effective fintuning methods for the standard NLP models: Pretrained language models (PLMs) that leverage the vast volume of natural language corpus are becoming universal tools to attack all NLP tasks. Hence, it is desirable to suggest effective finetuning methods for PLM rather than designing specialized architectures only applicable to specific domains.
    In compositional generalization tasks, I suggested a parsing tree annotation techniques that significantly enhance PLMs' accuracy \textbf{(published in IEEE ACCESS 2021)}.  
\end{itemize}
Other than that, I am also interested in techniques to compress large models for edge computing.\\
